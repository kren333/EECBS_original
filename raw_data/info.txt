this will contain 2 directories:
    bd contains each backward djikstra output for each EECBS run. This will be uniquely identified by the EECBS instance file.
    paths contains each paths.txt for each EECBS run. This will be uniquely identified by the EECBS instance file (/bd) as well as the 
          map which was run, and so the format of each path file will be mapname-bdname.txt.
